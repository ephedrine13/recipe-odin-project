# Recipe Project
This is my git for my odin project course

## About
On this project I will make a recipe website using just pure HTML to learn the basics and to showcase what I've know throughout the course.

This project will consist of three different recipes pages (Fish, Meat and Chicken).
With each pages it will have 4 recipes.
